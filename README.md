## Foundational Rules
| Rules | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Randomize the game | All Pokémon, movesets, move tutors, and items are randomized, with Trainer Pokémon & Wild Pokémon levels increased by <b>50%</b>. |
| Medium Slow Growth Rates | All Pokémon have Medium Slow Growth Rate. |
| No Shops | You can only use items that you pick up or are given by an NPC, no use of stores except for any type of Pokeball or Repel. |
| No Redos | You may not re-fight trainers at any point using the VS Seeker or other means. You may not abuse respawning items by picking them up more than once |
| "Set" Battles Only | You must use "Set" battle type in the in-game settings. |
| No Healing Items outside of Battle | No HP, PP (other than PP up/max), or status Healing Items while outside of battle (all flutes are illegal). |
| No Relearner Abuse | You cannot use the Move Relearner NPC to teach Sketch to a Pokemon that has already sketched a move. |

## Catching Rules
| Rules | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Pick your Starter | You may pick any mon you want in the lab. Your choice must still follow all other restrictions (i.e. no duplicate mons/typing & BST limit) |
| Build your Foundation | For pre-Brock (FRLG) or pre-Sprout Tower (HGSS) encounters ONLY you may choose which Pokémon to catch on each route. The catches must still follow all other restrictions (i.e. no duplicate mons/typing & BST limit). If you KO the mon or it faints while attempting to catch you still lose your encounter on that route. |
| Get Oak's Balls | The catching rule does not start until you get the 5 Pokeballs from Oak in the beginning of the game. If you get a ball on your starter your catches still do not start until you get the 5 Pokeballs. |
| Catch 1 per Route | You may catch the first Pokemon per Route. If the first Pokemon is the same type as your partner's Pokemon on that route you may re-encounter. |
| Link your Catches | You and your partner's catches on each route are linked. The linked pokemon cannot be the same type. |
| No Uber Strong Mons | You are NOT allowed to catch a mon that has 600+ BST (Legendaries under 600 BST are ALLOWED). If you evo into a mon with 600+ BST you are allowed to run it. |
| Dupes Clause | You are NOT allowed to catch a pokemon that has already been caught by you or that you have already evolved into. If you encounter one you are allowed to re-encounter. If you evo into a dupe you are allowed to run it. |
| Trading | NPC trades ARE allowed; however, the traded mon cannot be a dupe and must still be a legal typing pair with the linked mon. |
| Accidental Kills | If you accidentally kill a Pokémon while trying to catch it, you will no longer be able to capture a Pokémon from that route. For pre-Brock routes this means that if it kills itself before you start throwing balls you are still allowed a catch on that route. |
| No Killing Wild Pokémon | If you accidentally kill a pokemon other than the first mon on a route then the run is over. |
| HM Friends | You may catch additional pokemon for HM use ONLY. You may not gain any advantage from the HM mon. |
| Banned Abilities | Using any physical move is banned while having Huge Power or Pure Power (special moves are okay).<br><br>Banned abilities don't apply to Pokémon with BST 420 or lower |

## Pokemon Team Rules
| Rules | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Team Composition | Linked Pokemon must be on the team at the same time. Both you and your partner's team must not repeat any Primary typing (this restriction is based on the Pokemon when caught; if it evos into a pair that repeats Primary typing it's allowed to be used). Pokemon pairs caught in dungeons (e.g. Mt. Moon) are legal to be used until you exit the dungeon regardless of team composition. |
| Variety is the Spice of Life | Each Pokemon may only be brought to a total of 3 gyms (Elite Four is exempt from this rule). It's recommended to keep track using the 'Marks' feature available from the PC. | 
| Keep the team leveled | You may use rare candies on each mon up to a specified level based on game progression. Additional rare candies are given in stacks of 99 by a NPC in Viridian City (FRLG) or by the Quagsire in lab (HGSS). The caps are listed below. |
| Ooo a Candy | If you find a rare candy as a random field item (i.e. not from the NPC who gives rare candies) then you may use it to go over the standard rare candy level limit. |
| Held Items Restriction | The only Held Items allowed are Smokeball (before fighting first forest trainer) and items that are consumed on use like berries, herbs, and Focus Sash |

## Gameplay Rules
| Rules | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Get out of Lab! | You are allowed to use illegal moves and any held items in the very first fight against your rival in Oak's Lab. |
| Permadeath | Once a Pokémon faints, you must release/store it along with the linked Pokemon. Your partner may finish the current battle ONLY as if that Pokemon is still alive. | 
| Game Over | Once all party Pokémon have fainted, the run is over, and you must restart with a newly randomized game. If you and your partner have a different last pokemon remaining (e.g. after a Gym Leader) the run is still over as there are no linked mons alive. |
| No Way Out Gyms | Once You Enter a Gym or Dojo, You cannot leave until you defeat ALL TRAINERS. Beat it or Die. |
| Stick Together | Start bosses (such as Gym Leaders and Rival) at the same time as your partner. |
| One Shot Dungeons | You can only enter a dungeon once unless the story requires a revisit. A Dungeon refers to:<li>Any Hideout</li><li>Any Cave with Trainers</li><li>Any Building with Trainers</li>Forests are not dungeons. |
| No Healing Stations in Dungeons | No Pokecenter-like healing in Dungeons (Example - Rocket Hideout NPC, SS Anne Bed, etc) |
| Stolen Items | You may not intentionally steal items from wild pokemon with moves like Thief, Covet, etc. Stealing them from a trainer battle is fine. |

## Fire Red / Leaf Green
* You are given a Smoke ball in the lab and 4 Nest balls outside of the lab; these are legal to use.

* Diglett Cave is NOT a dungeon since there are no trainers.
* The SS Anne Dungeon begins as soon as you flash your SS Anne ticket and just like Kaizo Ironmon the Rival fight must be the first fight you do.
* You ARE allowed to save state in the beginning of your Safari Zone encounter to guarantee the catch (just load state if the pokemon runs)
* You ARE allowed to enter Sevii Islands.
## Heart Gold / Soul Silver
* You are allowed to grab 7 Master balls from the Quagsire in the lab, you cannot use these until after beating Rival and telling the Police Officer their name.
* In order to beat the game, you have to beat both Red and the E4 Rematch after getting all 8 Kanto badges.
