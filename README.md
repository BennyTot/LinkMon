| Medium Slow Growth Rates | All Pokémon have Medium Slow Growth Rate, except for Legendaries which are set to Slow. |
| No Shops | You can only use items that you pick up or are given by an NPC, no use of stores except for any type of Pokeball or Repel. |

## Catching Rules
| Rules | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Pick your Starter | You may pick any mon you want in the lab that is 599 BST or lower. |
| Get Oak's Balls | The catching rule does not start until you get the 5 Pokeballs from Oak in the beginning of the game. If you get a ball on your starter your catches still do not start until you get the 5 Pokeballs. |
| Catch 1 per Route | You may catch the first Pokemon per Route. If the first Pokemon is the same type as your partner's Pokemon on that route you may re-encounter. |
| Link your Catches | You and your partner's catches on each route are linked. The linked pokemon cannot be the same type. |
| No Uber Strong Mons | You are NOT allowed to catch a mon that has 600+ BST (Legendaries under 600 BST are ALLOWED). If you evo into a mon with 600+ BST you are allowed to run it. |
| Dupes Clause | You are NOT allowed to catch a pokemon that has already been caught by you. If you encounter one you are allowed to re-encounter. If you evo into a dupe you are allowed to run it. |
| Trading | NPC trades ARE allowed; however, the traded mon cannot be a dupe and must still be a legal typing pair with the linked mon. |
| Accidental Kills | If you accidentally kill a Pokémon while trying to catch it, you will no longer be able to capture a Pokémon from that Route. |
| No Killing Wild Pokémon | If you accidentally kill a pokemon other than the first mon on a route then the run is over. |
| HM Friends | You may catch additional pokemon for HM use ONLY. You may not gain any advantage from the HM mon. |
| Banned Abilities | Using any physical move is banned while having Huge Power or Pure Power (special moves are okay).<br><br>Banned abilities don't apply to Pokémon with BST 420 or lower |

## Pokemon Team Rules
| Rules | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Team Composition | Linked Pokemon must be on the team at the same time. Both you and your partner's team must not repeat any Primary typing (this restriction is based on the Pokemon when caught; if it evos into a pair that repeats Primary typing it's allowed to be used). |
| Variety is the Spice of Life | Each Pokemon may only be brought to a total of 4 gyms (Elite Four is exempt from this rule). It's recommended to keep track using the 'Marks' feature available from the PC. | 
| Keep the team leveled | You may use rare candies on each mon up to a specified level based on game progression. Additional rare candies are given in stacks of 99 by a NPC in Viridian City. The caps are listed below. |
| Ooo a Candy | If you find a rare candy as a random field item (i.e. not from the NPC who gives rare candies) then you may use it to go over the standard rare candy level limit. |
| Held Items Restriction | The only Held Items allowed are Smokeball (before fighting first forest trainer) and items that are consumed on use like berries, herbs, and Focus Sash |

## Gameplay Rules
| Rules | Details |

| Get out of Lab! | You are allowed to use illegal moves and any held items in the very first fight against your rival in Oak's Lab. |
| Permadeath | Once a Pokémon faints, you must release/store it along with the linked Pokemon. Your partner may finish the current battle ONLY as if that Pokemon is still alive. | 
| Game Over | Once all party Pokémon have fainted, the run is over, and you must restart with a newly randomized game. If you and your partner have a different last pokemon remaining (e.g. after a Gym Leader) the run is still over as there are no linked mons alive. |
